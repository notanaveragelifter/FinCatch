# FinCatch - Financial Knowledge Processing System

## Overview
**FinCatch** is a system designed to process and analyze financial knowledge extracted from various articles. The system consists of three main components: an **Extractor**, a **Causal Relationship Visualizer**, and a **Clustering Module**. These components work together to extract, visualize, and cluster financial data, providing valuable insights for investment decisions.

## Assignment Overview
This coding task is designed to evaluate skills in data extraction, natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization within a financial context. The problem involves developing a system that processes financial knowledge through three key components:

1. **Extractor**: A module that extracts meaningful content from financial articles and structures the data into a usable format.
2. **Causal Relationship Visualizer**: A system to identify and visualize causal relationships in the extracted financial knowledge using graph databases.
3. **Clustering Module**: A component that groups related financial knowledge based on content and identified relationships.

The task is expected to be completed within 48 hours, providing an opportunity to demonstrate both technical proficiency and the ability to manage and implement a project within a realistic timeframe.

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a system for a financial analysis firm that processes financial knowledge. The system has three main components:

### Q1 Extractor
- **Objective**: Implement a module that processes URLs from a given CSV file containing 30 articles about financial knowledge, extracts relevant information, and outputs a structured dataset. The dataset includes the article title, meaningful content, and a summary of the article.
- **Scalability**: The solution must be scalable to handle processing of large datasets (e.g., 1,000 or more articles).

### Q2 Causal Relationship Visualizer
- **Objective**: Design a system that visualizes the causal relationships between financial concepts. This will be done using a graph database, such as Neo4j, to store and query the relationships between different pieces of financial knowledge.
- **Goal**: Implement algorithms to identify potential causal relationships and provide a visual interface for exploring the causal graph.

### Q3 Clustering Module
- **Objective**: Develop a module that clusters the financial knowledge into groups based on their content and relationships. The module should evaluate the quality of clustering and visualize the results.

## Key Considerations
- **Scalability**: The system should be designed to efficiently handle large amounts of data (up to 100,000 articles).
- **Error Handling & Rate Limiting**: Implement robust error handling, especially for the web scraping component, and ensure rate limiting to avoid overloading external resources.
- **Performance**: Focus on optimizing performance for data extraction, relationship visualization, and clustering to handle real-time or large-scale data.

## Challenges
### Scalability
One of the primary challenges is ensuring that the system can scale efficiently, especially when handling large datasets. The solution leverages parallel processing and optimization techniques to ensure performance remains high even when processing thousands of articles.

### Accuracy
Ensuring the accuracy of data extraction and the identification of meaningful relationships is essential. Natural language processing techniques were applied to extract content relevant to the financial domain and to summarize the articles effectively.

### Performance
Optimizing the performance of the clustering and causal relationship visualization components was critical. Efficient algorithms for clustering and graph database queries were used to ensure that the system can process large volumes of data quickly and provide meaningful insights.

## Future Directions
The system can be extended in several ways to provide additional value, such as:
- **Real-time Processing**: Incorporating real-time data processing capabilities for continuous financial market analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developing predictive models based on historical data to forecast trends in the financial markets.
- **Integration with Other Data Sources**: Including additional datasets, such as stock prices and market trends, to enhance the system's ability to provide actionable insights for investment decisions.

This assignment tests not only the ability to implement the required components but also the ability to design scalable, efficient systems capable of handling real-world financial data.
